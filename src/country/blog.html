            <p>Welcome to the first week of “Blogs” here the developers and I will write updates that have happened
                during
                the week whether that might be behind the scenes or publicly. This is mainly about updating the
                community
                what has happened.</p>
            <p>
                This week me and CraftWiz77 have decided to start this website! By July the website, that you are
                looking at
                now, will be published so people can view all of the things in it. In this website I will not reveal too
                much but here are the basic ideas to guide you. Firstly, these blogs will not be continued to be posted
                on
                this server and they will be posted on the website (so stay tuned!) and there will be a “History”
                section
                that explains the Country history in full detail. Although, we will have plenty of time to publish this
                website and add everything don’t be dissatisfied when you see that there is not a lot as we will be
                continuously be working on this website so expect weekly updates. There will also be a changelog. If you
                don’t know what that means basically we will be making updates about what happens inside of country to
                update you.

            <p>This week I (ElectricTree274) have been working hard on an estate and many houses to go into the estate.
                I
                have also added a device in the HQ which can skip the night if you pay an emerald. I have also added a
                car
                park and tunnels to the central train station.
